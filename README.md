# Challenge Tracker Application

This project is part of my learning journey with Entity Framework Core. I am building an application to track challenges—whether physical, mental, or of any other type—that I want to accomplish within a certain time frame, similar to a bucket list.

### Learning Goal

I am using this application to learn Entity Framework Core, from beginner to advanced. As I progress through my learning, I will be updating and enhancing the project. 

### Features

- Track challenges of different types (physical, mental, etc.)
- Set start and end dates for each challenge
- Monitor progress over time

### Technologies

- C#
- LINQ
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server and PostgreSQL
- GitHub for version control

### How to Contribute

This is an ongoing learning project. Feel free to follow along, suggest improvements, or ask questions. Updates and improvements will be made as I continue to learn and apply new concepts of Entity Framework Core.
